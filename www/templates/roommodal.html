	<!--I think this can add objects through a $scope, so could be accessible and work without rooms
	it should have a way that it can be attached to a point so it will drag - perhaps a schematic? 
		these objects, once added, should allow to click to edit, resize, minimize, or add photos to the notes, etc.
		as with rooms, when do they share points/walls?-->
